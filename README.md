## Multiple Positions (user can be an organizer and a participant)

  1. General users: 

  - This App could grab the user's current IP address and automatically provide nearby events on the map.
  - Users can search events by location, date, categories, and other features (require a mask or vaccinated).
  - Users can check event details and send RSVPs to participate in the event.
  2. Organizers (Hostings)
  - Event organizers can review application details and arrange event applications (reject or approve).
  - Organizers can preview events after creating, and managing an event by editing, deleting, and changing status to completed
  3. Participants (Bookings)
  - Participants can check RSVP status, including Pending, Approved, Rejected, Event Cancel, and Event completed.
  - Participants can review incoming events and event history.
